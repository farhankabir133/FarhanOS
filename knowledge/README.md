## Usage

This knowledge base is consumed by `api/knowledge-loader.ts`, which provides:
- `searchKnowledge(query, options)` — TF-IDF hybrid retrieval with metadata filtering
- `getRelated(docId, limit)` — Relationship-based expansion
- `getAllDocs()` — Full public document list
- `listCategories()` — Category index

## Retrieval Strategy

- Hybrid keyword/semantic search
- Metadata filtering (category, tags, priority, confidence)
- Relationship graph traversal
- Time-based and priority-weighted ranking

## Maintenance

See `architecture/MAINTENANCE.md` for guidelines on adding documents, updating relationships, and re-indexing.
